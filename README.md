# hello-world2
This repository is a redo of the first while I practice the GitHub Flow.
I'm Nathaniel, but most call me Nathan. I moved to Indiana into a small town named Knox. Many folks here call it a city, but growing up in a city, this is definitly a town in my opinion. I've grown to like it here better than living in a city. I think I'm content living in a country-esk kind of town.
